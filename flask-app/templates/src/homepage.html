        <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>

        <p>
            We want to relieve the stress faced by high school and college students in picking their outfits for school. Have you ever had a day where you are just in a rush and grab the most random clothes that do not go together at all, or just had outfit options you loved but forgot about them. Well, this app lets you upload pictures of all your clothing and autogenerates outfits based on the type of fit you want, such as athletic, casual, relaxed, etc. It also lets you see all your clothes in one place, as well as wardrobes.
        </p>

        <p>
            This app lets you update photos of all your clothings and the AI system will choose your outfit for the day based on what fit you are going for (athletic, professional, casual, fancy).
